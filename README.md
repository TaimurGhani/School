Everything in this repository is work that I have done at NYU in puruit of a B.S in Computer Science.

Classwork located in this repository from NYU Tandon School of Engineering:

- CS 1134: Data Structures and Algorithms (Python 3.x)
- CS 2121: Object Oriented Programming (C++)

I am also part of NYU's programming team, Poly Programming Team. Practice work for that can be found in other repositories.
